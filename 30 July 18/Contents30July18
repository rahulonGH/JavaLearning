Wildcards in Generics
-----------------------
(? is known as Wildcard in generic programing)
wildcards represent UNKNOWN TYPE.
we can't use wildcards while invoking generic methods and instantiating generic class.

3 types of wildcard implementation
--------------------------------------
1. Upper Bound Wildcard  [it allows us to pass arguements of Upper Bound or its Subclass]
========================
A extends B
<? extends TypeName>
Student <? extends String>

public static double doAddition(List<? extends Number> list){

}
 
2. Lower Bound WildCard [it allows us to pass arguments of lower Bound or its super class]
==========================
<? super TypeName>

public static double doAddition(List<? super Integer> list){
}

3. Unbounded Wildcard [whenever we want the generics to be working with any type]
======================
<?> or <? extends Object>

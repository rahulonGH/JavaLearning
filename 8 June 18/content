OOP
====
its an approach of programming where we emphasize more on data rather than code.
it is capable of overcoming the complexity of Proceural approch of programming.

Abstraction
=============
it is an essential elemnt of OOP which enable us to handl the complexity of real world.
we can ignore the details of an object , so that we can focus on necessary data.

Encapsulation
===================
it is mechanism to bind together the DATA+COde.
we can cotroll the access ovr data using encapsulation.

a class is a basic of unit of encapsulation.

Polymorphism
==============
POLY + Forms
it allows one method to be used for a common class of actions.
to achive polymorphism Method overloading and method Overriding is used.

Inheritance
=============
with inheritance we can create hierachy of classes to share the properties.
it is concept of Reusability.
 Inherited class ==  superclass
 Inheriting classs == subclass
 
using inheritance we can create general class that defines common set of properties, and that class can be further inherited.
'extends' keyword is used to inherit from superclass

No class can be a super class of itself.
We can only specify one superclass for any subclass that we create.
java doesn't support the inheritance of multiple classes into a single class.i.e Multiple inheritance is not supported in java.

private class member will remain private to its class, it can't be accessed using any code outside its class, including subclass.

Constructors
==============
Similar to the method , but having same name as class. And it can't return any value. not even void.
it is used to initialize the object.

default constructor/No argument
parameterized constructor

Why constructors not return any value?
 Because, the implicit return type of a class constructor is the CLASS TYPE itself.

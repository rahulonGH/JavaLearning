Set
====
unique elements with insertion order
Set is modeled on mathematical set abstraction.

it contains only the methods inherited from Collection interface and adding restrictions that duplicate elements can be prohibited.

Implemntation classes
======================
HashSet
LinkedHashSet
TreeSet


SortedSet[I]
NavigableSet[I]

Set {1,8,9,5,6,7}

Searching Techniques
----------------------
Linear Search
Binary Search
Hashing

Hashing

keys	HashTable[10] [][1][][][][5][6][7][8][9] [h(x) = x]
1
8
9
5
6
7

h(x) = x % size [1][][8][][][][][][][]
if Collision of index occurs for elements:
 chaining- making a linkedList of collided elements
 Linear Probing - putting the collided element in next empty index of hashtable
 					h(x) = [h(x)+f(i)]% Size    {f(i) = index  i.e 0,1,2}
 Qudratic Probing - h(x) = [h(x)+f(i^2)]% Size    {f(i) = index  i.e 0,1,2}			
 	
 Hashing is a technique searching by indexing the Keys to the index of HashTable
 HashTable is a normal array implentation to hold the elemnts
 HashCode is the returned integer value of any hashing funtion.
 
 tree
 		A
 	B			C
 D		E	F		G		
 
 TreeSet doesn't allow null element because it uses compareTo() method to compare elements of tree nodes.

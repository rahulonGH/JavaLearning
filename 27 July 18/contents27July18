Enumeration
============
list of named constants
part of legacy system, but obsolete for new code; however nit yet deprecated.

methods
---------------
hasMoreElemnts()
nextElement()


Queue
---------
when we need to represent group of individual objects 'prior to processing' the Queues are preferred
eg: to-do List, mailing list
usually it follows FIFO, but we can change the priority based on some comparison.

Mostly used implementation class of Queue is PriorityQueue,LinkedList,Dequeue

boolean add(Object e) -- adds an element
Object remove()  -- retrieve and remove the first element(head).
Object poll()  -- retrieve and remove the first element(head) and return null if queue is empty.
Object peek()  -- retrieve but not remove the head element and return null if queue is empty.
Object element() -- retrieving but not removing.

[3][2][1][][]
tail	head

Priority Queue
==============
Not in FIFO
elements must be of comparable type
String and All the wrapper classes are by default comparable

Wildcard in generics.
Comparable example with Priority queues.

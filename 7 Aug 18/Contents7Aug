JDBC [Java database connectivity]
==================================
java API to connect and execute queries with the Database.
JDBC uses jdbc drivers to connect with DB[any type].

types of drivers
====================
1. JDBC-ODBC bridge driver [removed from java 8]
2. Native-API driver [partially java]
3. Network Protocol driver [Fully Java]
4. Thin driver or Type-4 Driver [Fully java]  {most efficient}

thin driver converts the JDBC calls directly into vendor specific DB calls

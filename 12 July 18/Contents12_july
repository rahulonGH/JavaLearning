final void suspend()
final void resume()
final void stop()

these methods were deprecated by JAVA 2
 
modern way of using suspend and resume,, is wait and notify, alongwith some condition check.


multi-threading is moreover "to think concurrently rather than serially".

if we have 2 subsystems within a programm that can execute parallelly/concurrently, make them individual threads.

if we r creating too many threads, we r actually degrading the performance rather than enhancing. we should always remember,
some overhead will be associated with Context Switching.

more the context switching ===== more CPU Utilization.

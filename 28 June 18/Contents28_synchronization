Synchronization
=============================================================
when one or more threads need access to a shared resource , 
they need some mechanism that ensures the resource will be used by only one thread at a time.

Event looping and Polling mechanism [ in single thread based application events where stored in a loop and get chosen by polling mechanism that is based on some condition]

Multithreading provides monitor concept. monitor is kind of lock on some resource.

Synchronization provides Mutually Exclusive Lock.

two ways to implement synchronization
=======================================
1. synchronized keyword
2. synchronized(Object){....} block

why synchronization not join()  ??
=====================================
main			worker

javadoc/// synchronization is a way to "prevent thread interference and memory consistency errors".
because of synchronization threads do not step on each other.

synchronized keyword can only be used with methods.

MultiThreading
=====================
 Multitasking
  can be achieved using 2 mechanisms:
    i. Multiprocessing 
    ii. MultiThreading ** lightwieght, less CPU cycle required to switch between threads, Faster
    
Single thread environment ... whenever a thread is blocked due to any reasons like resource not availble....
the entire program will wait.

every thread has its own execution path, hence they are independent from each other.

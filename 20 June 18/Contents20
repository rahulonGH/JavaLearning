Marker interface
=================

which has no members eg. Serializable

Nested Interface / Member interface
=================
an interface can be declared as a member of class or another interface
nested interface can be public, protected and private

outside of class or interface , in which a nested interface is declared; its name must be fully qualified 
i.e classname/interfacename.NestedInterfcaeName

nested interfaces are static implicitly.

Control flow describes the flow of program execution

public static void main(String stya[]){
	
}
compiler will look for the main method first of all
main is the method name which defines the starting point of execution
public is modifier that makes this method publicly availble
void defines that main method should not return anything
static refers that the member will be common or shared to its class. this will have a single copy.
String arg[] is the string array passe as argumrnt to main method.

why arguments need to be passed to main method?
whenever any value is required by main method we can pass as String[] arguemnt

Arrays are the collection of similar datatypes

int arr[] = {1,121,7};
String stya[] = {"R","S"};

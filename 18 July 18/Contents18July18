Generics
=========
generics are the facility of generic programming.

A type or a method--- to operate on objects of various types,while providing compile type safety.

a class type that can refer to any class type is known as Generic class.

	class ClassGenerics<T>{
	  T obj;
	  void add(T obj){
	  this.obj = obj);
	  }
	  void get(){
	   return obj;
	  }
	}
	
Type Parameters for Generics
----------------------------
T - type
E - element
K - Key
V - Value
N - number

Generic methods
-----------------
-->it can accept any type of arguments



List - ordered and allow duplicates
Set - ordered but not allow duplicates
Queue - if we need a collection(group of individual objects as a single entity) prior to processing  ..
		Queue supports FIFO methodology usually, but the priority can be changed based on some compartor.
		
# there are two ways to iterate collection element:
 		for each loop and Iterator and its methods

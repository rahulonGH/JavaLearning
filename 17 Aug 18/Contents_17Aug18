Connectivity
-------------
-- Registering driver class
-- Creating connection
-- Creating Statement
-- Exexcuting the queries
-- Closing Connection

-->Registering driver class
   	 Class class has a method forName() , which help to register driver.
     public static void forName(String jdbcdriverClassName) throws ClassNotFoundException
     
     eg: Class.forName("oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver");
     
-->getConnection() of DriverManager class
	 public static Connection getConnection(String url) throws SQLException
	 
	 eg: Connection c = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:oracle:thin:@localhost:1521:XE","username","password");
	 
-->createStatement() of Connection interface.  -> the statement object will be responsible for executing the queries with db
		eg: Statement stmt = c.createStatement();
		
--> Executing the statement/queries
	executeQuery() of Statement interface--->returns the ResultSet that can be used to get all the records of a table.
	
-->Closing connection
	close();
	
	c.close();
